<h1>Clone of Atari 2600 Adventure</h1>

<p>In 2001, I wanted to learn DirectX 2D and see what it was like to develop a video game.  I didn't want to get caught up in any graphic design or game design, so I chose to clone the classic Atari 2600 game, Adventure, which is one of my all-time favorites.</p>

<li><a href="http://naildrivin5.com/adventure/">My Adventure Website</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Source</h1>

<p>The source is C++, and should compile with Visual Studio, though I haven't used Windows since I wrote this and can't guarantee anything.</p>

<p>I'm sure some of the the bitmaps and sounds are copyrighted, but who's it hurting anyway?</p>
